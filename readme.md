Unison is a social media site. The site is built with the Noroff Social API. This project was the course assigment in Javascript 2.

## Description

In this project we used the Noroff Social API to make a social media site. Features:

- User can register new account
- User can log in with created account
- User can post, edit and delete post, comment on other posts, edit profile media and react to posts.

This project is designed to get practice with HTTP methods in Javascript. We also chose to learn Tailwind and use it in this project.
The other main learning outcome on this project was working together and learning git. Throughout this whole project we have reviewed each others pull request, and worked with branches in git for good workflow.
